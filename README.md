Information theory course design

Course purpose: Using programming languages to implement Huffman, Fano, Shannon coding


A. Coding requirements:

1. Huffman coding: to achieve the optimal R-base coding of any N-double sequence information source of Q symbol, here:

8<=Q<=15, 2<=R<=5, 1<=N<=3.

2. Fano, Shannon coding: to achieve the binary coding of any Q symbol source, here:

Q>=10.



B. Programming requirements:

1. Programming languages are not limited.(Here is a Python version)

2. The program should have a visual operation interface under windows, and different coding types are divided by different menus.

3. For Huffman coding should have the ability to input Q, N, R, and Fano, Shannon coding can input Q.

4. Different coding types should show the results of coding, average code length, information entropy and other performance indicators.



C. Submission of requirements

1. Procedure submission requirements:

Have a complete programming file: including the call of the function library, a variety of script program files, 
to ensure that it can run normally in the corresponding software environment, to have the '.exe' file that can run independently under windows.

2. Course design submission requirements:

Complete course design report: doc document including design purpose, content, process, result presentation, etc
